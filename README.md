Given a JSON file with a list of people and their dates of birth, write a program to print out the people whose birthday is today.

If a person was born on Feb 29th, then their birthday during a non-leap year should be considered to be Feb 28th.

Input sample file:

```
[
    ["Doe", "John", "1982/10/08"],
    ["Wayne", "Bruce", "1965/01/30"],
    ["Gaga", "Lady", "1986/03/28"],
    ["Curry", "Mark", "1988/02/29"]
]
```

You can use whichever programming language you like. The assignment should take 60 to 90 min. If it’s taking longer, consider whether you’re complicating things.

If you make any assumptions, trade-offs or de-prioritise features for timeliness, please document these decisions.
